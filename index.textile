h2. What is BigTuna?

BigTuna is continuous integration software. "Martin Fowler's page":http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html describes what is continuous integration.

h2. Installation

BigTuna is built ontop of Rails 3 framework. Currently it's been tested with Postgres as database backend, but the database scheme is quite simple and there should be no problems running it on SQLite.

For simple development setup, go with standard Rails procedure.

bc. git clone git@github.com:appelier/bigtuna.git
rake db:schema:load
rails s
