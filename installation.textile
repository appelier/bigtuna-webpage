h2. Deploying

BigTuna comes with @config/deploy.rb.sample@ file to use it with Capistrano. It will help you maintain your BigTuna installation and update it without problems.

The file itself is a standard Capistrano deploy file but it adds few tasks to ensure your BigTuna works out of the box after redeploying.

bc. after "deploy:finalize_update", "deploy:symlink_configs"
before "deploy:restart", "deploy:bootstrap"

@deploy:symlink_configs@ task updates your config files and shared build directory which BigTuna will use to keep its builds.
@deploy:bootstrap@ migrates database and restarts the delayed job runner so that it works with the latest code

h2(#nginx). Setting up BigTuna with Nginx and Passenger

We assume you have your Nginx instance set up, what you need now is a @server@ entry.

bc. server {
  listen 80;
  server_name bigtuna.your.domain;
  root /big_tuna/root/public;
  passenger_enabled on;
}

After installing read the "configuration section":configuration.html.
